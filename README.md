# The Endless Shooter

## Alert: There are things that are yet to be implemented
* Implement one type of enemy - one that's about the same size as the player but shoots and relentlessly follows the player.
* Implement a second type of enemy - one that's circular in shape and radially shoots its bullets, while also rotating on its axis.
* Introducing a health system for the player that is indicated by the shifting colors (for eg. green &#8594; yellow &#8594; red).
* Change button mappings for XBox controllers.
* Update README with details of the completed project.
