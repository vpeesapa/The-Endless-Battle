# The Endless Shooter

## What works at the moment
* Player can rotate based on the mouse's position
* Player can move while pointing towards the mouse pointer
* Player can aim in any direction and fire bullets based on where they are pointing towards.
* Player can be contolled using a controller (**Note**: Tested using only a **PS4 controller**).
* Bullets' collision with makeshift blocks can be detected, resulting in both being removed.

## Alert: There are things that are yet to be implemented
* Implement one type of enemy - one that's about the same size as the player but shoots and relentlessly follows the player.
* Implement a second type of enemy - one that's circular in shape and radially shoots its bullets, while also rotating on its axis.
* Introducing a health system for the player that is indicated by shifting the colors (for eg. green &#8594; yellow &#8594; red).
* Change button mappings for XBox controllers.
* Update README with details of the completed project.
